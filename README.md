We have two dining halls in our campus they both serve different foods, 
but we are not able to know what are the foods they are serving for specific day, 
so students take blind bets every time when they go to one or usually go to the one they are nearby

This web application is going to provide students with information 
what are the menus of both of the dining halls so they can pick 
and choose what type of food they would like to eat.
